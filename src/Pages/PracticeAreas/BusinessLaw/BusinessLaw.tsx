      <p>Ashworth Law Firm represents a wide variety of business clients, from Corporations and Limited Liability
      Companies to Non-Profit entities. Our clients range from businesses starting out and going through the
      business entity formation process, to businesses that have been around for decades, but need to change
      in order to stay competitive or be in compliance with current laws. We offer comprehensive representation
      for our business clients, whether we are simply reviewing  your operating agreement or charter, drafting
      resolutions to authorize company actions, or protecting your companyâ€™s interests in court. Our attorneys
      can also help guide your business through the dissolution process, making sure that you remain in compliance
      with Tennessee law throughout the winding-up of your company.
      </p><p>
      Most of all, we offer business owners the peace of mind and legal counsel that they can trust, based on our wide-ranging experience in the business
      world. Please contact our office to make an appointment with one of our attorneys, and put Ashworth Law
      Firm to work for your LLC, Corporation, or Non-profit entity. Our offices are conveniently located in
      downtown Franklin, but we are more than happy to meet you at your home or place of business in Middle Tennessee.

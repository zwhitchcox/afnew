      <h2>Commercial Leases</h2>
      <p>Commercial Leases Ashworth Law Firm represents various businesses that include landlords,
      tenants, restaurant chains, athletic gyms, bridal  shops,  worldwide  electronics  manufacturers,
      land  developers,  builders  and  contractors,  and  investors. Growing a business and expanding
      into new commercial office or retail space is an exciting venture. However, commercial leases
      are highly complex legal agreements that require the assistance of an experienced attorney in
      several  different  areas  of  the  law.  Successfully  and  strategically  negotiating  a
      commercial  lease  could  be  a significant factor in the overall success and longevity
      of your business. “Form Contracts” that are not customized to each specific client’s situation
      are dangerous and can be financially devastating if misused. Our attorneys take a methodical
      approach  to  lease  negotiations  in  order  to  protect  our  client’s  interests  and  also
      potentially  inject financial value into the transaction.
      </p><p>
      Most commercial leases contain industry specific provisions and aggressive  financial
      obligations. Our attorneys have  practical  experience  and  backgrounds  in  various
      businesses  that  add  a  valuable  strategic  element  to  the negotiation process.
      Negotiating specific terms such as HVAC repairs and replacement, common area maintenancefees,
      tenant  improvement  allowances,  options  to  extend, rights  of  first  refusal,
      and  other  warranties  and representations can be the difference your business needs to
      succeed. These specific lease terms equate to dollars and cents. Our goal is to strategically
      structure your lease with such precision that you are in the best legal position possible,
      which in turn, affects your bottom line. When our clients succeed, we succeed. Call one of
      our skilled attorneys today to represent and assist you through the commercial lease process.
